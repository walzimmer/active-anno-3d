# Network Interface and IP Addresses:

    1.  each device connected to a network (like this workstation or the machine running ProAnno) has one or more
        network interfaces. these can be either physical (like Ethernet) or virtual like Wi-Fi.
    2.  each network interface is assigned to an IP address, which is used to identify the device on the network


# Accessing Flask Server on the Network

    -   Flask running on '0.0.0.0' means that it listens for incoming connecting on port 5000 on all network interfaces
        of the host machine. it doesn't mean the Flask server is accessible on the IP '0.0.0.0', but rather at the IP
        address assigned to the host machine on our network.
    
    -   to access this Flask server from the ProAnno tool running on a different machine, we should use the IP address of
        the machine where the Flask app is running, followed by the port number.

        for example, if the IP address of the workstation is 192.168.1.5 and the Flask server is running on port 5000,
        then from the ProAnno tool on another machine we would access the Flask app using 'http://192.168.1.5:5000'


# Triggering a Python Script from Another Machine

    1.  Determine the workstation's IP address: the IP address where the Flask server is running.
        this IP address will be used by ProAnno to send the request.
    
    2.  send an HTTP request from ProAnno: in ProAnno we need to add a functionality to send an HTTP request to
        the Flask server running on the workstation. we can use Python's 'requests' library for this purpose.



# Send a frame ID from ProAnno and return an array from Workstation #TODO


# you need to have the same conda environment running in both the docker container and in the flask app

    - inside the docker container -->   conda env export > environment.yml
    - copy the environment.yaml to the folder with flask_app.py
    - if you want to change the conda env name --> open environment.yaml and modify the old conda env name
    - in the terminal inside the flask_app folder --> conda env create -f environment.yaml
    - conda activate <env name>
